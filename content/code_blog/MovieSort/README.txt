--How to Compile--

This program uses a Makefile to compile. While in the program directory, the following commands can be used to compile and run the program:

make all
    -- This command will compile the entire program using a Makefile, and generate two new files in the directory, movies.o and the executable movies.

make clean
    -- This command will clean up the program directory by removing the two file generated by 'make all'.

./movies <filename>
    -- Once the program is compiled, this command will run the program in the terminal. The execution parameter <filename> must be replaced with a valid
        csv or similerly formated file that is present in the program directory, otherwise execution will fail.
